## What is Cypress?

A tool to test what is run on a browser.

A testing tool created for developers.

Cypress operates by creating two iframes, one of them runs our application, and the other one runs the Cypress script. This setup enables Cypress to interact directly with our application, eliminating any need for a middleware. That's a significant distinction from tools like Playwright or Selenium.
